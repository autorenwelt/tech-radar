jc,Assess,Tools,TRUE,"<b>Original Description from Thoughtworks:</b><br>In our previous Radar, we placed modern Unix commands in Assess. One of the commands featured in that collection of tools was jq, effectively a sed for JSON. jc performs a related task: it takes the output of common Unix commands and parses the output into JSON. The two commands together provide a bridge between the Unix CLI world and the raft of libraries and tools that operate on JSON. When writing simple scripts, for example, for software deployment or gathering troubleshooting information, having the myriad of different Unix command output formats mapped into well-defined JSON can save a lot of time and effort. As with jq, you need to make sure the command is available. It can be installed from many of the well-known package repositories. Link: https://kellyjonbrazil.github.io/jc/docs/"
